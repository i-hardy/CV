I am a **Full Stack Junior Developer** looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, and where I will be challenged to achieve more.

I chose to change career and pursue programming following a period of upheaval in my life, which prompted me to reconsider my priorities. I decided I wanted to work in a field in which I would be intellectually challenged and able to apply both creative and logical thinking processes to solve problems and apply a craft.
