I am a **Full Stack Developer** who loves to build first-class user experiences and work with excellent and exciting new technologies. I am passionate about clean code and test-driven development, and crafting software with care and skill.

## Skills

### Technical
- Javascript (ES6+)
- Vue, React
- Front-end tooling (Webpack, Gulp, CSS preprocessors)
- NodeJS (Hapi, Express)
- GraphQL
- Functional programming
- Docker
- AWS
- Git and Unix shell
- Ruby, Lua, Rust

### Excellent communicator
My skills in communication were developed both in the context of my academic work, in which I made presentations and gave papers to seminars and at conferences, and through my voluntary work at Nightline and the Samaritans, where I offered calm and a listening ear to people across the spectrum of society at times of personal crisis.

### Fast learner
My ability to pick up new skills quickly is perhaps best exemplified by my progress at Makers Academy, where I went from the very basic Ruby I'd picked up at Codecademy to building a full-scale final project in only 12 weeks.

I am also accustomed to solo learning, having taught myself skills ranging from HTML and CSS to playing the guitar. I have excellent research skills and am confident in my ability to discern what I need to learn, and then go and learn it.

### Collaborator
In my time employed in local government I worked with teams across a wide variety of service areas, from transport planning to childrens' services, and learned to be adaptable to working with a wide range of people.

Since moving into development I have come to deeply value and enjoy the shared creative process of building software. I particularly enjoy opportunities to share knowledge with colleagues; I recently developed a workshop and training exercises on front-end testing and test-driven development for other front-end developers at my current company.

## Projects
#### Professional
| Name | Technologies | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
|Data Out | Vue, GraphQL, Kong/Lua | A client facing data export SPA with a simple interface allowing users to build complex GraphQL queries to extract data from an API. The work included implementing new security mechanisms to safeguard sensitive personal data whilst integrating with a legacy product, requiring a custom Kong plugin. |
|[Madgex.com](https://www.madgex.com) | Craft CMS, MySQL | With no prior experience building CMS-driven sites or working with the LAMP stack, I rebuilt the company website from scratch in twelve weeks, with the centrepiece being a custom page builder that enables the marketing team to create and manage pages with little need for developer involvement. |
|Insights | Vue | A client-facing data analytics SPA. In order to upgrade an inherited codebase from Vue 1 to Vue 2 I had to largely rebuild the front end, but in doing so was able to thoroughly rearchitect the app to make it extensible and maintainable for the long term. |
