I am a **Full Stack Junior Developer** looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, and where I will be challenged to achieve more.

I chose to change career and pursue programming following a period of upheaval in my life, which prompted me to reconsider my priorities. I decided I wanted to work in a field in which I would be intellectually challenged and able to use both creative and logical thinking processes to solve problems and apply a craft.

##<a name="skills"></a> Skills

#### Excellent communicator

My skills in communication were developed both in the context of my academic work, in which I made presentations and gave papers to seminars and at conferences, and through my voluntary work at Nightline and the Samaritans, where I offered calm and a listening to people across the spectrum of society at times of personal crisis.

#### Fast learner

My ability to pick up new skills quickly is perhaps best exemplified by my progress at Makers Academy, where I went from the very basic Ruby I'd picked up at Codecademy to building a full-scale final project.

I am also accustomed to solo learning, having taught myself skills ranging from HTML and CSS to playing the guitar.
