I am a **Full Stack Junior Developer** looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, and where I will be challenged to achieve more.

I chose to change career and pursue programming following a period of upheaval in my life, which prompted me to reconsider my priorities. I decided I wanted to work in a field in which I would be intellectually challenged and able to use both creative and logical thinking processes to solve problems and apply a craft, and have discovered an enormous love of coding and a passion for clean, clear and well-tested software design.

## Skills

#### Analytical thinker

My academic background in Theology, while not the most obvious field to precede a career in software development, has enabled me to develop excellent analytical thinking skills and an ability to think in complex, abstract terms as well as more concrete ones.

#### Excellent communicator

My skills in communication were developed both in the context of my academic work, in which I made presentations and gave papers to seminars and at conferences, and through my voluntary work at Nightline and the Samaritans, where I offered calm and a listening ear to people across the spectrum of society at times of personal crisis.

#### Fast learner

My ability to pick up new skills quickly is perhaps best exemplified by my progress at Makers Academy, where I went from the very basic Ruby I'd picked up at Codecademy to building a full-scale final project. 

I am also accustomed to solo learning, having taught myself skills ranging from HTML and CSS to playing the guitar. I have excellent research skills and am confident in my ability to discern what I need to learn, and then go and learn it.

#### Collaborator

In my time employed in local government I worked with teams across a wide variety of service areas, from transport planning to childrens' services, and learned to be adaptable to working with a wide range of people.

In my time at Maker's Academy I have honed my collaboration skills in the context of small team projects, and in the work of the whole cohort of students supporting and assisting one anothers' learning.

|[Ynstagram](https://github.com/i-hardy/instagram-challenge)| Ruby, Rails, Postgresql, ImageMagick | An Instagram clone built for a weekend challenge- I went beyond the spec and also implemented user profiles, tagging, and the ability to follow other users |

#### Personal Projects
| Name | Technologies | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
|[Makkachin Bot](https://github.com/i-hardy/makkachin-bot) | Ruby, Discord API | On my first day of the Makers course, a friend asked for my help in setting up a  Discord bot that she'd found on GitHub. Neither of us were able to get it working, but despite being entirely new to Discord as a platform, working with Ruby gems, and working with an API, I was intrigued by the idea of writing a bot to spec from scratch, and put together the first version of this bot over the next few evenings. |
| Raspberry Pi Server | Linux, Apache, Jekyll, Git | In order to experiment directly with server building and operation I bought a Raspberry Pi 3 and, with a little trial and error, set it up with a simple LAMP stack in order to host [my personal website](https://www.imogenhardy.co.uk). As the website uses a Jekyll template, I also set up a post-receive git hook to rebuild the site every time I push a new commit|
|[Catfight](https://github.com/i-hardy/catfight)| JavaScript, React |  Using create-react-app to bootstrap the project, I decided to rebuild the week three 'Battle' Sinatra app with React, and take the opportunity to expand the game. The game gets random cat pictures from [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com) to represent the players, and permits a variety of attacks to ensure a thrilling and glorious game. |
