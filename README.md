I am a **Full Stack Junior Developer** looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, and where I will be challenged to achieve more.

I chose to change career and pursue programming following a period of upheaval in my life, which prompted me to reconsider my priorities. I decided I wanted to work in a field in which I would be intellectually challenged and able to use both creative and logical thinking processes to solve problems and apply a craft, and have discovered an enormous love of coding and a passion for clean, clear and well-tested software design.

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator

My skills in communication were developed both in the context of my academic work, in which I made presentations and gave papers to seminars and at conferences, and through my voluntary work at Nightline and the Samaritans, where I offered calm and a listening ear to people across the spectrum of society at times of personal crisis.

#### Fast learner

My ability to pick up new skills quickly is perhaps best exemplified by my progress at Makers Academy, where I went from the very basic Ruby I'd picked up at Codecademy to building a full-scale final project.

I am also accustomed to solo learning, having taught myself skills ranging from HTML and CSS to playing the guitar.

## Projects

#### At Makers Academy

#### Personal Projects
- On my first day of the Makers course, the owner of a Discord server that I had just joined asked for my help in setting up a bot that she'd found on GitHub. Neither of us were able to get it working, but despite being entirely new to Discord as a platform, working with Ruby gems, and working with an API, I was intrigued by the thought of writing a bot to spec from scratch. Over the next couple of evenings I put together the first iteration of [Makkachin Bot](https://github.com/i-hardy/makkachin-bot), which I have continued to improve on since.
- My experience of trying to get the bot hosted online, to save me from having to keep a terminal window open 24/7, got me interested in how servers and hosting actually work. In order to experiment directly I bought a Raspberry Pi 3 and, with a little trial and error, set it up with a simple LAMP stack in order to host [my personal website](https://www.imogenhardy.co.uk). As the website uses a Jekyll template, I also set up a post-receive git hook to rebuild the site every time I push a new commit.
