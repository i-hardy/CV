I am a **Full Stack Javascript Developer** who loves to build first-class user experiences and work with excellent and exciting new technologies. I am passionate about clean code and test-driven development, and crafting software with care and skill.

## Skills

### Technical
- Javascript (ES6, frameworks and vanilla)
- Front-end tooling (Webpack, Gulp, CSS preprocessors)
- DOM APIs
- Node
- Ruby (Rails, Sinatra, general scripting)
- Docker
- AWS
- Git and Unix shell

### Excellent communicator
My skills in communication were developed both in the context of my academic work, in which I made presentations and gave papers to seminars and at conferences, and through my voluntary work at Nightline and the Samaritans, where I offered calm and a listening ear to people across the spectrum of society at times of personal crisis.

### Fast learner
My ability to pick up new skills quickly is perhaps best exemplified by my progress at Makers Academy, where I went from the very basic Ruby I'd picked up at Codecademy to building a full-scale final project in only 12 weeks.

I am also accustomed to solo learning, having taught myself skills ranging from HTML and CSS to playing the guitar. I have excellent research skills and am confident in my ability to discern what I need to learn, and then go and learn it.

### Collaborator
In my time employed in local government I worked with teams across a wide variety of service areas, from transport planning to childrens' services, and learned to be adaptable to working with a wide range of people.

Since moving into development I have come to deeply value and enjoy the shared creative process of building software. I particularly enjoy opportunities to share knowledge with colleagues; I recently developed a workshop and training exercises on front-end testing and test-driven development for other front-end developers at my current company.
